# Notes App

Project Overview:

The Notes App is a personal full-stack application that allows users to create, view, manage, edit, and delete notes securely. The app includes user authentication to ensure that each user can only access their own notes.

The project demonstrates full-stack development skills by combining a modern React front-end with a Node.js and Express.js back-end, alongside Supabase for authentication and data storage.

Features:

User authentication (register and login)

Secure access to personal notes

Create, edit, and delete notes

User dashboard for managing notes

Responsive and clean UI

Technologies Used:

Frontend:
